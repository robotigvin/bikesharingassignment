## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- I am executing this project as part of an assessment on my learning of Linear Regression through Upgrad.
- This project will create an LR model using Python that will help the business understand the impacts of various parameters on the demand of their shared bikes based on data of 2 previous years. That way the business can concentrate on a smaller set of specific parameters to target to try and increase the demand.
- The dataset being used is a list of 15 independent variables and the demand for 2 years, 2018 and 2019.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temperature plays the most important role in demand for shared bikes. Warmer days show increased demand. Days with light-show and some rain show the least demand. As expected, rainy days with thunderstorms show no demand at all.
- With an adjusted R-squared score of 78%, the model I created can be a very good tool to used for forecasting the demand for shared bikes.

## Technologies Used
- matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Acknowledgements
Give credit here.
- This project required the right understanding of the concepts of LR model building using python. I am grateful to Sri Harish from Upgrad for taking the time out to conduct one-on-one sessions with me to get my basics right.
